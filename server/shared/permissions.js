/**
 * Every permission a person in a business can hold, grouped the way the
 * Staff screen shows them. Read by the server (to work out what someone may
 * do) and by the app (to draw the permission grid), so the two never disagree.
 *
 * A few keys are broad ones the app started with ("stock", "prices",
 * "customers", ...). Each still means what it always did, and also stands
 * for the finer permissions listed under it in EXPANDS: anyone who held
 * "stock" before keeps stock in, adjustments, counts and transfers. That
 * keeps every existing role and stored grant working unchanged, while the
 * owner can now take any single one of those finer permissions away.
